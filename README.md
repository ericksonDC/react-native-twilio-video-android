Twilio Video for React Native on Android

This implements bindings between the [Twilio Video service](https://www.twilio.com/video) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) on Android.

This package tries to adhere to the functionality and interface of the excellent [react-native-twilio-video-webrtc library](https://github.com/gaston23/react-native-twilio-video-webrtc). For usage instructions, I recommend you check that package out; if you managed to get your project up and running on iOS using that package then you should be able to just swap out that package for this one on Android.

This package owes much of its code to @ralphpina's awesome [twiliorn library](https://github.com/ralphpina/twiliorn).
